## Problem 1 - Sort (80pt + 20pt)



### 1. (10pts)

Because median is surely not one of the extemes, we can try $n-2$ times eliminiate the impossible i-of-median one by one. The remaining two $P$ will be the extremes. 

```cpp=
Find-Extremes(P)
    Is = [1,2,3]
   
    for j = 4 to P.len+1
        i = PANCAKE-GOD-ORACLE(P,Is...)
        remove(Is[i])
        if j == P.len+1
            break
        append(Is, j)
    
    return Is
```

Therefore, totoal iteration is $n-1$ times $\in O(n)$

### 2. (20pts)


The main idea is how to convert `PANCAKE-GOD-ORACLE` into a **comparison function**, and use this comparison function to achieve the optimal of comparison sort.


**Making a comparison function**

Since we got the extremes, to say $P_{ext_1}$ and $P_{ext_2}$, we can use one of the $P_{ext}$ as a baseline. We need to prove the following equality

``` wrap=
compare(i,j) = i == PANCAKE-GOD-ORACLE(P[i], P[j], P_ext)
```

where $i,j\notin \{ P_{ext1}, P_{ext2} \}$

- when `P[i] < P[j]` and `P_ext` is maximum
    - `compare(i,j) == 1`
- Otherwise
    - `compare(i,j) == 2`
- because  $P_{ext}$ is always bigger or smaller than both of `P[i]` and `P[j]`
- For `P_ext` is a minimum, vice versa.
- We can not know `compare` is `argmin` or `argmax` function of `P[i]` and `P[j]`. But we can guarantee the monotonicity by using `compare` in quick sort.


**Apply to comparison sort**


Since we got the comparison function, we need to first allocate extremes to `P[1]` and `P[end]`. we can apply sorting algorithm, which is optimal in time complexity, to the sequence `P[2]...P[end-1]` (Noted that at this moment, $P[1]=P_{ext1}$, $P[end] = P_{ext2}$, $P[i] = P_k~if~k\in \{1,\cdots,end-1\}$). To acheive $O(n\lg n)$, I chose **quick sort** to the region with index `[2,...,end-1]` and use `compare` function proved above. For clarity, I listed the pseudo code below which is modified from *ITA P.171*:

```cpp=
Quicksort(A,p,r)
    if compare(p,r)
        q =Partition(A,p,r)
        Quicksort(A,p, q-1)
        Quicksort(A, q+1,r)
end 

Partition(A,p,r)
    x = A[r]
    i = p-1
    for j = p to r-1
        if compare(A[j],x) == 1
            i = i+1
            exchange A[j] with A[i]
    
    exchange A[r] with A[i+1]
    
    return i+1  
end

Sort(P)
    Is = Find-Extremes(P)
    allocate Is to P[1] and P[end]
    Quicksort(P,2,P.end-1)
end
```


**Query Complexity**

- For finding extrema: $O(n)$
- For sorting: It is implemented in quick sort that has the time complexity of $O(n\lg n)$. This complexity can be regarded the calling times of `compare` which uses the `PANCAKE-GOD-ORACLE`. Therefore, the overall query complexity is $n\lg n$.

### 3. (10pts)

The insertion takes in two parts: 

1. Comparison to extrema
2. Binary search with extrema as a base number

Let another pancake be `P_new` with testiness `t_new`. And assume list `L` is sorted with extremes locate at `L[1]` and `L[end]`. We want to find a site `i` to insert  `P_new` such that `L[i]`

**Comparison to extrema**

```=
Pancake-God-Oracle(L[1], L[end], P_new)
```

- if `output=1`: Insert `P_new` at front
- else if `output=end`: Insert `P_new` at reat
- Else:
    - Use binary search to find location


**Binary Search**

As described in [P1-2](#1-10pts), we can use extrema to build a **comparison function** from `Pancake-God-Oracle`. After checking `P_new` is between `L[1]` and `L[end]`, we can use the comparison function to binary search which acheive $O(n\lg n)$ complexity.


```python=
Insert(L, P_new)
    i = Pancake-God-Oracle(L[1],L[end],P_new)
    if i==1
        insert P_new at 1
    elseif i==end
        insert P_new at end
    else
        I = Binary-Search(L[2:end],P_new)
        insert P_new at I+1
end

compare(i,j)
    I = Pancake-God-Oracle(i,j, L[1])
    if I==i
        return 1 # i>j
    else 
        return 2 
end

Binary-Search(L,P_new)
    high = L.end
    low = 1
    value ans;
    while (high>=low)
        mid = (high + low)/2
        if compare(L[mid], P_new) == 1
            high = mid - 1
        else
            ans = mid
            low = mid + 1
        end
    end
    
    return ans
end
```


The reason to use bianry search:

1. $L$ is sorted
2. `P_new` is in the middle of the extremas.

[^lc:BT]:[LeetCode: Binary Tree Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/solution/)


### 4. (15pt)


**Definition of root element**

The definition of a root is always the **first** element of the **preorder traversal**. Thus, the determination of a root is unique, which is `inorder[1]`.

**Definition of leaves**

With a given root/subroot, the definition of left and right sets of leaves is unique (**Fig. 2-2**). Recursively, all the set of leaves will be uniquely distributed with complete inorder and preorder traversal.

**Conclusion**

Ther is no two binary trees share with the same `(inorder, preorder)` pair.

## Problem 3 - Heap (55pt)

### 1. (15pts)

**ðŸ’¡Idea**

- **Direction of change**: First of all, if `x.key == v`, there is no need to move the element `x` We need to know the new assigned value `v` is greater or smaller. 
- **Case 1: `x.key` is increased**:   
    - There is only one possibility: going downward to leaf.
- **Case 2: `x.key` is decreased**:
    - Going upward to root.

Both *Case 1* and *Case 2* can be recursively (or loop) implemented. The only difference is the direction of movement.

**Fig 3-1.** Moving direction of node `x`.
</center>


**ðŸ”§Implementation**

```cpp=
h.modify(x, v){
    if (x.key==v)
      //Do nothing
    else if(x.key>v)
        h.increaseKey(x,v)
    else
        h.decreaseKey(x,v)
}


h.decreaseKey(x,v){
    assert(x.key > v)
    x.key = v
    while(parent(x) != NULL and parent(x).key > v){
        swap( parent(x), x) 
    }
}


h.increaseKey(x,y){
    assert(x.key < v)
    x.key = v
    
    while( not all of x.leaves[:] is NULL ){
        //Get the node with minimum key
        min_node = argmin(x.leaves[:]) 
        if(min_node.key < x.key){
            swap(min_node, x)
        }
    }
    
}
```

**Description**

- `h.decreaseKey`: For going upward, there is only one neighbor. That is `parent`
- `h.increaseKey`: Going downward is more complicated. We need to choose the direction in the following conditions:
    - **NUll end**: Terminate here
    - **One NULL end**: Choose the node with key
    - **Both leaves have key**: Choose the `minimum` to swap

**Notes**

1. I use `x.leaves[:]` is for generosity, that means there can be leaves more than two like **d-ary heap**
2. The `swap` function switches two variables.

### 3.(10pt)

**ðŸ’¡Idea**

- **$\log(NM)$ is the sum of two heaps' operation**
    - Since all of operations mentioned `O(log(nm))` time compleixty, it is likey the result of **two-heap-operation**, which causes `O(log(m) + log(n))` operation of a paired heap
- How to know the **availability** of an item?
    - For each element $A_{i,j}$, we need to labelled the availability by using `struct` or build another one-to-one map to store the data of availability. The status of an item can be:
        1. Undefined
        2. Available
        3. Extracted


- Each column/row requires a heap to keep the track on the minimum. There will be $M+N$ heaps. 
- Each node should keep track on its location `i` and `j`. To

1. Node $A_{i,j}$ 
    ```cpp=
    struct node{

        i
        j
        iHr // location at row heap
        iHc //location at col heap

        len //[0,N]/[0.M]

3. Data Structure `D`

    struct D{
        heap Hc[M]
        heap Hr[N]
        node A[N,M]
    }
    ```


**ðŸ”§Implementation: Operations**



1. `D.add(i, j, v)`
    ```cpp=
    function add(d::D, i,j,v)
        //Register A[i,j]
        d.A[i,j].avail = true
        d.A[i,j].i = i
        d.A[i,j].j = j
        d.A[i,j].key = v

        insertHeap(d.Hc[j], &d.A[i,j]) 
    end
    ```
    
    We have to extract all unavailable values until find the reachable minimum.

2. `D.extractMinRow(i)`

    ```cpp=
    function extractMinRow(d::D, r)

        d.Hr[0].avail = false
        extractMinHeap(d.Hr[r])
        deleteHeap(d.Hc, d.Hr[0].iHc) //heap deletion

    end
    ```



### 4. (20pt)

In **Fig. 3-2**, $M+N$ heaps have been estbalished for tracking the minimum value of columns and rows. 

#### Add
We need two heap insertions to track the minimum values of column `j` and row `i`. Therefore, the time complexity is `O(log M + log N) = O(log MN)`


#### Extract

The extraction on either `col` or `row` requires a following heap deletion. Both of them requires `O(log(h))`. Therefore, the sum of complexity is `O(log N + log M)`


#### Deletion

We need to delete the same item in two heaps. Use the `iHc` and `iHr` to keep track on the location. The deletion can be done by simply set `d.Hrp[iHc] = -Inf` with heapify and extraction. All of them requires logarithmic time complexity on each side. In summary, the total time complexity is `O(log N + log M)`
